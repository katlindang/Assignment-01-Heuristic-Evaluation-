descrioption of the heuristic:


| Number | Heuristic & Description                   | Evaluation | Recommendation | Severity Rating |
|--------|------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1      |  Visibility of System Status  | The home page is very plain and simple; however, it allows the user to focus on flow pedagogy of learning. The site allows users to flow from the most basic steps of learning electronic music to more intermediate as you follow the path that was created for the users. There is not a section where you can switch inbetween individual sections. If you wanted to look at a previous section, you would have to press "previous" multiple times | Create a bar at the bottom of the page where users can toggle between pages within each specific section | 3 |
| 2      | Match Between System and the Real World | Good: It has a sidebar that allows users to click individual sections, like "beats", "notes and scales", or "chords". Bad: There is a section that is listed as "the playground". On the beats section, it dives right into the playing with the beats before explaining what "an open hat or closed hat" means. | Change the name of the category to something easier to understand. Explain the concepts before the users start blindly intereacting with the beats | 2 |
| 3      | User Control and Freedom              | Good: The users are allowed to play around with the beats and turn on and off individual beats to see how the sounds differ. It has a reset button to start again from the default settings. Bad: Some sounds are on default, so you would have to individually unclick all of them to create your own sound.   | Include a button where you can clear all default music settings | 1 |
| 4      | Consistency and Standards	   | Good: Follows the same pattern all throughout. It has a good teaching flow, so people can follow along Bad: Needs to have more subcategories users can click on. Users can get lost inbtween all of the pages they are clicking through.     | Create more subcategories on the sidebar | 2 | 
| 5      | Error Prevention         |  Good:           |
| 6      | Recognition Rather Than Recall	                    |            |
| 7      | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use	                    |            |
| 8      | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design	                    |            |
| 9     | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors	                    |            |
| 10     |  Help and Documentation	                    |            |
